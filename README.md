# Convert 32 bit to 64 bit TIFF

Converts a 32 bit multipage tiff file to a 64 bit multipage big tiff file.

This is not a general tool! It was made to convert tiff files from a specific source. 
Specifically, 16 bit tiff files from a FLIR thermal imaging camera that are larger than 4.3 GB.
Performance on tiff files from other sources is unknown.
